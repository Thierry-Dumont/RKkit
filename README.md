### This repository will (soon) be populated with SageMath tools to play with Runge--Kutta  methods. ###

To use the codes, you must install [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)

To learn about Ordinary Differential Equations solvers, you should read the
_bible_:

*    Solving Ordinary Differential Equations I, by Hairer, NÃ¸rsett,, Wanner,
*    Solving Ordinary Differential Equations II Stiff and Differential-Algebraic
    Problems by Hairer and Wanner,
*    Geometric Numerical Integration by Hairer, Lubich and Wanner.


##### Note: ####
If you want to learn _SageMath_, you can read the book _Mathematical Computation
with Sage_ (which now is available in French, English and German), and
for which freely available pdf files are [downloadable 
here](https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/sagebook/english.html) and [there](http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/).
