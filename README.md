This repository will (soon) be populated with SageMath tools to play with
Runge--Kutta  methods.

To learn about Ordinary Differential Equations solvers, you should read the
bible:

*    Solving Ordinary Differential Equations I, by Hairer, NÃ¸rsett,, Wanner,
*    Solving Ordinary Differential Equations II Stiff and Differential-Algebraic
    Problems by Hairer and Wanner,
*    Geometric Numerical Integration by Hairer, Lubich and Wanner.
